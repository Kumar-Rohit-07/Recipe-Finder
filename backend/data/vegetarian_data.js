Peel and prick them with a fork. Shallow-fry in oil until golden brown and set aside.\n\nHeat 2 tablespoons of oil in a deep pan. Add cumin seeds, bay leaf, and a pinch of asafoetida. Once they crackle, add ginger-garlic paste and sauté for a minute.\n\nStir in tomato puree and cook until oil separates. Lower the flame and add Kashmiri red chilli powder, coriander powder, turmeric, fennel powder, garam masala, and salt. Mix well.\n\nGradually add whisked yogurt while stirring continuously to prevent curdling. Cook until the gravy thickens and oil starts leaving the sides.\n\nAdd fried potatoes and 1 cup of water. Mix gently and simmer on low heat (dum) for 10–12 minutes with the lid covered to absorb all flavors.\n\nGarnish with chopped coriander and serve hot with naan, roti, or steamed rice. A perfect royal dish from the heart of Kashmir!"
